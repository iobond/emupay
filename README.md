Emupay is a secure bitcoin wallet platform for both desktop and mobile devices. Emupay uses [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for peer synchronization and network interfacing.

Binary versions of Emupay are available for download at [aib.one](https://aib.one/#download). Emupay Binaries are signed with the key `dev@aib.one` – See the section [`How to Verify Emupay Signatures`](https://github.com/iobond/emupay#how-to-verify-copay-signatures) for details.

This project was created by BitPay Inc, and it is maintained by BitPay and houndreds of contributors. There is a BitPay branded version of Emupay at mobile phone stores, BitPay Wallet, which features integration with the BitPay Visa Debit Card, as its main difference.

## Testing in a Browser

> **Note:** This method should only be used for development purposes. When running Emupay in a normal browser environment, browser extensions and other malicious code might have access to internal data and private keys. For production use, see the latest official [releases](https://github.com/iobond/emupay/releases/).

Clone the repo and open the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iobond/emupay.git
cd copay
```

Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install and start Emupay:

```sh
npm install
npm run apply:copay
npm run start
```

Visit [`localhost:8100`](http://localhost:8100/) to view the app.

## Unit & E2E Tests (Karma & Protractor)

To run the tests, run:

```
 npm run test
```

## Testing on Real Devices

It's recommended that all final testing be done on a real device – both to assess performance and to enable features that are unavailable to the emulator (e.g. a device camera).

### Android

Follow the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/) to set up your development environment.

When your developement enviroment is ready, run the `start:android` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run start:android
```

### iOS

Follow the [Cordova iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/) to set up your development environment.

When your developement enviroment is ready, run the `start:ios` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run start:ios
```

<!-- ### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)

The desktop version of Emupay currently uses NW.js, an app runtime based on Chromium. To get started, first install NW.js on your system from [the NW.js website](https://nwjs.io/).

When NW.js is installed, run the `start:desktop` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:copay
npm run start:desktop
``` -->

## Build Emupay App Bundles

Before building the release version for a platform, run the `clean-all` command to delete any untracked files in your current working directory. (Be sure to stash any uncommited changes you've made.) This guarantees consistency across builds for the current state of this repository.

The `final` commands build the production version of the app, and bundle it with the release version of the platform being built.

### Android

```sh
npm run clean-all
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run final:android
```

### iOS

```sh
npm run clean-all
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run final:ios
```

<!-- ### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)

```sh
npm run clean-all
npm run apply:copay
npm run final:desktop
``` -->

## Configuration

### Enable External Services

To enable external services, set the `COPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION` or `BITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION` environment variable to the location of your configuration before running the `apply` task.

```sh
COPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION="~/.copay/externalServices.json" npm run apply:copay
# or
BITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION="~/.bitpay/externalServices.json" npm run apply:bitpay
```

## About Emupay

### General

Emupay implements a multisig wallet using [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) addresses. It supports multiple wallets, each with its own configuration, such as 3-of-5 (3 required signatures from 5 participant peers) or 2-of-3. To create a multisig wallet shared between multiple participants, Emupay requires the extended public keys of all the wallet participants. Those public keys are then incorporated into the wallet configuration and combined to generate a payment address where funds can be sent into the wallet. Conversely, each participant manages their own private key and that private key is never transmitted anywhere.

To unlock a payment and spend the wallet's funds, a quorum of participant signatures must be collected and assembled in the transaction. The funds cannot be spent without at least the minimum number of signatures required by the wallet configuration (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 6-of-6, etc.). Once a transaction proposal is created, the proposal is distributed among the wallet participants for each to sign the transaction locally. Finally, when the transaction is signed, the last signing participant will broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Emupay also implements [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) to generate new addresses for peers. The public key that each participant contributes to the wallet is a BIP32 extended public key. As additional public keys are needed for wallet operations (to produce new addresses to receive payments into the wallet, for example) new public keys can be derived from the participants' original extended public keys. Once again, it's important to stress that each participant keeps their own private keys locally - private keys are not shared - and are used to sign transaction proposals to make payments from the shared wallet.

For more information regarding how addresses are generated using this procedure, see: [Structure for Deterministic P2SH Multisignature Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki).

## Emupay Backups and Recovery

Since v1.2 Emupay uses BIP39 mnemonics for backing up wallets. The BIP44 standard is used for wallet address derivation. Multisig wallets use P2SH addresses, while non-multisig wallets use P2PKH.

Information about backup and recovery procedures is available at: https://github.com/iobond/emupay/blob/master/backupRecovery.md

Previous versions of Emupay used files as backups. See the following section.

It is possible to recover funds from a Emupay Wallet without using Emupay or the Wallet Service, check the [Emupay Recovery Tool](https://github.com/iobond/emupay-recovery/tree/master).

## Wallet Export Format

Emupay encrypts the backup with the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/). To extract the private key of your wallet you can go to settings, choose your wallet, click in "more options", then "wallet information", scroll to the bottom and click in "Extended Private Key". That information is enough to sign any transaction from your wallet, so be careful when handling it!

The backup also contains the key `publicKeyRing` that holds the extended public keys of the Copayers.
Depending on the key `derivationStrategy`, addresses are derived using
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki). Wallets created in Emupay v1.2 and forward always use BIP44, all previous wallets use BIP45. Also note that since Emupay version v1.2, non-multisig wallets use address types Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) while multisig wallets still use Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (key `addressType` at the backup):

| Emupay Version | Wallet Type               | Derivation Strategy | Address Type |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| <1.2          | All                       | BIP45               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.2          | Non-multisig              | BIP44               | P2PKH        |
| ≥1.2          | Multisig                  | BIP44               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.5          | Multisig Hardware wallets | BIP44 (root m/48’)  | P2SH         |

Using a tool like [Bitcore PlayGround](http://bitcore.io/playground) all wallet addresses can be generated. (TIP: Use the `Address` section for P2PKH address type wallets and `Multisig Address` for P2SH address type wallets). For multisig addresses, the required number of signatures (key `m` on the export) is also needed to recreate the addresses.

BIP45 note: All addresses generated at BWS with BIP45 use the 'shared cosigner index' (2147483647) so Emupay address indexes look like: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x` for main addresses and `m/45'/2147483647/1/y` for change addresses.

Since version 1.5, Emupay uses the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This was coordinated with Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format is still similar to BIP44, the root was in order to indicate that these wallets are not discoverable by scanning addresses for funds. Address generation for multisignature wallets requires the other copayers extended public keys.

## Bitcore Wallet Service

Emupay depends on [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for blockchain information, networking and Copayer synchronization. A BWS instance can be setup and operational within minutes or you can use a public instance like `https://bws.bitpay.com`. Switching between BWS instances is very simple and can be done with a click from within Emupay. BWS also allows Emupay to interoperate with other wallets like [Bitcore Wallet CLI](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet).

## Release Schedules

Emupay uses the `MAJOR.MINOR.BATCH` convention for versioning. Any release that adds features should modify the MINOR or MAJOR number.

### Bug Fixing Releases

We release bug fixes as soon as possible for all platforms. Usually around a week after patches, a new release is made with language translation updates (like 1.1.4 and then 1.1.5). There is no coordination so all platforms are updated at the same time.

### Minor and Major Releases

- t+0: tag the release 1.2 and "text lock" (meaning only non-text related bug fixes. Though this rule is sometimes broken, it's good to make a rule.)
- t+7: testing for 1.2 is finished, translation is also finished, and 1.2.1 is tagged with all translations along with bug fixes made in the last week.
- t+7: iOS is submitted for 1.2.1. All other platforms are submitted with auto-release off.
- t + (~17): All platforms 1.2.1 are released when Apple approves the iOS application update.

## How to Verify Emupay Signatures

1.  Download the `copay@bitpay.com` public key (`gpg --recv-keys 1112CFA1`)
2.  Download Emupay binary (`$FILENAME`) and signature file (`$FILENAME.sig`)
3.  Verify the signature by running:

```bash
$ gpg --verify \
 $FILENAME.sig \
 $FILENAME

# It should return:
Good signature from "Emupay (visit copay.io) <copay@bitpay.com>"
```
